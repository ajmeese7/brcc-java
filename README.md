# brcc-java

This is the code for the projects I have created for Object-Oriented
Programming (JAVA) at Baton Rouge Community College as a dual-enrollment
student.

This is posted here as an example if you are taking a similar course and get
extremely stuck. This is NOT to be used to cheat on your assignments, and I
accept no responsibility if make the mistake of doing so. The point of taking
a programming course is to learn, and cheating entirely defeats the purpose.
